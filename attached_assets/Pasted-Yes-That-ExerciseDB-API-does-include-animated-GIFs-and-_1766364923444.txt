Yes. That ExerciseDB API does include animated GIFs, and this is very good news for your product direction.

Below is a clear, implementation-level answer tailored to your current FitForge stack, including constraints, best practices, and how to turn this into a competitive advantage without breaking App Store rules or performance.

⸻

1. What ExerciseDB Actually Provides (Confirmed)

The ExerciseDB API on RapidAPI provides, per exercise:
	•	gifUrl → animated exercise demonstration
	•	bodyPart
	•	target
	•	secondaryMuscles
	•	equipment
	•	instructions

Example response fields:

{
  "name": "dumbbell bench press",
  "bodyPart": "chest",
  "target": "pectorals",
  "equipment": "dumbbell",
  "gifUrl": "https://v2.exercisedb.io/image/xxxxx.gif"
}

So yes:
You can replicate the animated exercise screens shown in your reference app using this API.

⸻

2. Can This Be Used in a Mobile App (iOS & Android)?

✅ Yes, with the correct approach
	•	GIFs are hosted remotely
	•	You are not downloading or redistributing
	•	You are displaying via URL
	•	This is App Store compliant

Important:
You must stream the GIF, not bundle it.

⸻

3. How to Implement GIFs Correctly in Expo (Critical)

❌ Do NOT use <Image> for GIFs on Android

Performance will be poor and inconsistent.

✅ Correct Approach

Option A: expo-image (Recommended)

import { Image } from "expo-image";

<Image
  source={{ uri: exercise.gifUrl }}
  style={{ width: "100%", height: 280 }}
  contentFit="contain"
  transition={200}
/>

Benefits:
	•	Hardware accelerated
	•	Caching
	•	Smooth playback
	•	Works on iOS and Android

This is the correct production choice.

⸻

4. Backend Integration (Important for Security)

DO NOT call RapidAPI directly from the client.

Instead:

Expo App
 → Express API
   → RapidAPI ExerciseDB
     → Response

Example Express Proxy

router.get("/api/exercises/:id", async (req, res) => {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://exercisedb.p.rapidapi.com/exercises/exercise/${req.params.id}`,
    {
      headers: {
        "X-RapidAPI-Key": process.env.RAPIDAPI_KEY,
        "X-RapidAPI-Host": "exercisedb.p.rapidapi.com"
      }
    }
  );

  const data = await response.json();
  res.json(data);
});

This:
	•	Protects your API key
	•	Lets you add caching
	•	Enables premium gating later

⸻

5. Performance Considerations (Very Important)

GIFs are heavy.

You should:
	•	Load GIFs only on the exercise detail screen
	•	Use thumbnails elsewhere
	•	Avoid auto-playing multiple GIFs in lists

Recommended UX Pattern
	•	Exercise list → static image
	•	Exercise detail → animated GIF
	•	Optional tap-to-play overlay

This mirrors the reference app and keeps scrolling smooth.

⸻

6. How This Fits Your Monetisation Strategy

This is where FitForge becomes better, not just similar.

Free Tier
	•	View exercise list
	•	Limited GIF views per day
	•	Basic workout generation

Pro Tier
	•	Unlimited animated exercise demos
	•	Smart exercise substitutions
	•	AI-generated plans

Elite Tier
	•	AI coaching
	•	Smart weight suggestions
	•	Recovery analysis

Animated GIFs become a visual hook, AI becomes the reason to pay.

⸻

7. How You Beat the Reference App Using the Same GIFs

The reference app shows:
	•	GIF
	•	Fixed reps
	•	Fixed rest
	•	Fixed weights

You can show:
	•	GIF
	•	AI-adjusted reps
	•	AI-adjusted rest
	•	Smart weight recommendations
	•	“Why this exercise is included”

Same GIF.
Much higher perceived intelligence.

⸻

8. Legal & Compliance Notes (Do Not Skip)
	•	Do not remove watermarks if present
	•	Do not claim ownership of exercise media
	•	Attribute ExerciseDB in your app credits
	•	Do not download or store GIFs locally

Follow these rules and you are safe.

⸻

9. Final Answer

Yes. You can absolutely build an app equal or superior to the one you showed using ExerciseDB GIFs and your current APIs.

You now have:
	•	Animated exercises
	•	Dynamic workouts
	•	AI intelligence
	•	Monetisation potential

This is a strong position.

⸻

10. Next Logical Build Step

I recommend next we do one of the following:
	1.	Design the Exercise Detail Screen (GIF + AI insights)
	2.	Implement Smart Weight Matching using AI
	3.	Define Free vs Pro limits for GIF usage
	4.	Add Exercise Substitution AI
	5.	Create production-ready Expo UI code

Tell me which number you want next, and I will continue with concrete code and architecture.
