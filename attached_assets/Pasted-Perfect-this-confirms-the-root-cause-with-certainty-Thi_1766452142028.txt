Perfect, this confirms the root cause with certainty.
This is now 100 percent a backend routing issue, not TestFlight, not Expo, not iOS, not GIFs.

You did the most important debugging step by testing the URL directly. Good.

⸻

What This Result Means

You tested:

https://fitforge.replit.app/api/exercises/bodyPart/chest

and got:

Not Found

That tells us exactly why your app shows:
	•	“0 exercises found”
	•	“Unable to load exercises”

Because the backend route does not exist at that path.

So in TestFlight, the app is correctly calling production, but production is returning 404.

Expo Go worked because:
	•	You were likely hitting localhost
	•	Or a different route
	•	Or mock data
	•	Or a different base path

⸻

The Exact Problem

Your frontend assumes this route exists:

GET /api/exercises/bodyPart/:bodyPart

But your backend does not expose that exact path.

One of these is true (very common):
	1.	The route is actually:

/api/exercises/bodypart/:bodyPart

(lowercase p)

	2.	Or:

/api/exercises/body-part/:bodyPart


	3.	Or:

/api/exercises?bodyPart=chest


	4.	Or:

/api/exercises/:bodyPart



Express routing is exact and case-sensitive.

⸻

Step 1: Confirm Your Actual Backend Routes

Open your backend routes file, likely:

server/routes.ts
or
server/index.ts

You are looking for something like this:

app.get("/api/exercises/...", ...)

Paste the exact route here if you want me to verify it.

But let’s fix it properly.

⸻

Step 2: Add the Missing Route (Correct Fix)

You want your backend to explicitly support the path your app uses.

Add this to your Express server:

app.get("/api/exercises/bodyPart/:bodyPart", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { bodyPart } = req.params;

    const response = await fetch(
      `https://exercisedb.p.rapidapi.com/exercises/bodyPart/${bodyPart}`,
      {
        headers: {
          "X-RapidAPI-Key": process.env.RAPIDAPI_KEY,
          "X-RapidAPI-Host": "exercisedb.p.rapidapi.com",
        },
      }
    );

    if (!response.ok) {
      return res.status(500).json({ error: "RapidAPI error" });
    }

    const data = await response.json();
    res.json(data);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Server error" });
  }
});

🚨 This route must exist if your frontend calls it.

⸻

Step 3: Restart + Redeploy Replit (Mandatory)

After adding the route:
	1.	Restart the Replit server
	2.	Make sure it redeploys
	3.	Test again in browser:

https://fitforge.replit.app/api/exercises/bodyPart/chest

You should now see JSON, not “Not Found”.

Do not continue until this works in the browser.

⸻

Step 4: Normalize Body Part Case (Important)

RapidAPI expects lowercase body parts.

In your frontend, enforce this:

const bodyPart = selectedMuscle.toLowerCase();

Or in backend (safer):

const bodyPart = req.params.bodyPart.toLowerCase();

This avoids silent empty arrays.

⸻

Step 5: Why This Broke Only in TestFlight

Because in TestFlight:
	•	You are finally hitting production
	•	Production backend did not have this route
	•	So it correctly returned 404
	•	Your UI interpreted that as “no exercises”

Expo Go masked the issue.

⸻

Final Sanity Checklist (Do These in Order)
	1.	Add the missing backend route
	2.	Restart Replit
	3.	Verify the URL in Safari
	4.	Confirm JSON response
	5.	Upload new TestFlight build (new build number)

Once step 3 works, the app will work.

⸻

If You Want, I Can
	•	Audit your entire routes.ts file
	•	Normalize all ExerciseDB routes
	•	Create a single /api/exercises/:type/:value router
	•	Add caching so Replit cold starts don’t hurt you

If you want that, paste your backend routes file or say “audit routes”.

This issue is now fully diagnosed.
