Good, this screenshot confirms exactly what is happening. You are **not missing anything**, and there is **no toggle you can change here**.

I will be very explicit so you can stop chasing a setting that does not exist.

## Key clarification (important)

**You cannot remove iPad support from App Store Connect via a checkbox anymore.**

Apple has **removed the “Devices: iPhone / iPad” control entirely** for iOS apps.

What you are seeing is correct.

The **Add Platform** screen only controls:

* iOS
* macOS
* tvOS
* visionOS

It does **not** control iPhone vs iPad.

## How Apple ACTUALLY determines iPad support now

Apple infers iPad support from **three signals only**:

1. **Do iPad screenshots exist?**
2. **Does the binary declare tablet support?**
3. **Does the app run correctly on an iPad simulator during review?**

There is no UI switch.

---

## What you must do (this is the only valid solution)

### ✅ Step 1: Remove ALL iPad screenshots (this is mandatory)

This alone resolves most rejections.

Go to:

* App Store → Previews and Screenshots
* Click **View All Sizes in Media Manager**
* Select **13-inch iPad**
* Delete **every screenshot**
* Ensure only iPhone sizes remain

If even one iPad screenshot exists, Apple assumes iPad support.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Explicitly disable tablet support in your app binary

Because you are using Expo / React Native, this step is **critical**.

In `app.json` or `app.config.js`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "ios": {
      "supportsTablet": false
    }
  }
}
```

Then:

* Increment build number
* Build again
* Upload the new build

This flag is what Apple checks internally.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Do NOT add iPad-specific UI

Do not:

* Add iPad layouts
* Add size class logic for iPad
* Reference iPad in metadata

Keep the app clearly iPhone-first.

## Why Apple rejected your submission

Apple saw:

* 13-inch iPad screenshots
* iPhone UI stretched to iPad
* A binary that did not explicitly opt out of tablets

That combination **forces** a 2.3.3 rejection automatically.

---

## What will happen after you fix this

Once you:

* Remove iPad screenshots
* Upload a new build with `supportsTablet: false`

Apple will:

* Treat FitForgeX as **iPhone-only**
* Stop checking iPad UI
* Pass guideline 2.3.3

This is routine and usually clears on the next review.

---

## What NOT to waste time on

* There is no Devices section anymore
* There is no hidden toggle
* There is no Apple Support ticket needed
* There is no way to “disable iPad” in the UI

You are already in the correct place.

---

## If you want, I can next:

* Verify your Expo config before you rebuild
* Tell you exactly what the reviewer simulator will check
* Help you re-enable iPad later the correct way
* Draft a short reviewer reply acknowledging the fix

Just tell me which one you want.
