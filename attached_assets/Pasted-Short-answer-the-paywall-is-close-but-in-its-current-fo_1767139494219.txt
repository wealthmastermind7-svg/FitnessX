Short answer: the paywall is close, but in its current form it is NOT App Store–safe.
Apple will likely reject again under Guideline 3.1.2 (Subscriptions) and possibly 1.4.1 (Health) unless you make a few specific, visible fixes.

Below is a precise, reviewer-grade assessment based on the screenshots you shared.

⸻

What is already GOOD (keep these)

✔ Clear plan selection (Monthly vs Yearly)
✔ Price shown clearly
✔ Restore Purchases visible
✔ Links row present (Terms, Privacy, Sources)
✔ Free trial is optional and user-controlled
✔ No misleading “limited time” pressure language

Visually, this is well designed and professional. The issues are compliance, not UI quality.

⸻

❌ What Apple will flag (important)

1. Missing auto-renewal disclosure text on the paywall

Apple requires explicit subscription terms ON the paywall screen, not only in the App Store description.

Right now, your paywall does not visibly state:
	•	Auto-renewal behavior
	•	Cancellation timing
	•	Apple ID billing

This is one of the most common rejection reasons.

⸻

2. “AI Coach” wording is too strong without safety framing

On the feature list you show:

AI Coach
Get personalized workout advice and fitness guidance

This can be interpreted as health or training advice unless softened.

Apple is already sensitive because they flagged you for medical citations earlier.

⸻

3. Free trial toggle lacks clarification

“Enable free trial” must clearly state:
	•	Duration (for example, 7 days)
	•	What happens after the trial ends

Apple expects this on the same screen.

⸻

✅ REQUIRED fixes (do these before resubmitting)

A. Add a mandatory disclosure block (small text is OK)

Place this directly above or below the Continue button:

Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase.
Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.
You can manage or cancel your subscription anytime in your Apple ID settings.

This is non-negotiable for approval.

⸻

B. Clarify the free trial toggle

Change the label to something like:

Enable free trial (7 days)

And add one line below:

You will not be charged until the trial ends.

If there is no free trial, remove the toggle entirely.

⸻

C. Soften the “AI Coach” language (very important)

Replace:

Get personalized workout advice and fitness guidance

With:

Receive AI-generated fitness suggestions and workout insights

This shifts it from “coaching” to general wellness guidance, which aligns with Apple’s safety rules.

You can keep the label AI Coach, but the description must be softened.

⸻

D. Keep the bottom links exactly as shown (good)

Your footer row is correct:
	•	Restore Purchases
	•	Terms
	•	Privacy
	•	Sources

Make sure all links open externally and load instantly.

⸻

✅ Apple-safe revised paywall copy (recommended)

You do NOT need to redesign. Just adjust text.

Feature list example:
	•	AI Coach
Receive AI-generated fitness suggestions and workout insights
	•	AI Workout Generation
Create custom workouts tailored to your goals and equipment
	•	Unlimited Workouts
Save up to 100 workouts instead of just 5
	•	Full Exercise Library
Access all 1,300+ exercises

Disclosure block (small text):

Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

⸻

Final verdict

As-is: ❌ High risk of rejection
With the fixes above: ✅ App Store–compliant and reviewer-safe

Your design is strong. You are failing only on mandatory Apple wording, not product quality.

⸻

Strong recommendation

Because Apple already flagged you once:
	•	Make all fixes in one build
	•	Do not submit partial fixes
	•	Reviewers reward “everything fixed at once”

⸻

If you want, I can:
	•	Rewrite the exact microcopy for every line
	•	Tell you where reviewers tap first on this screen
	•	Validate your RevenueCat configuration vs UI
	•	Check if your free trial duration matches metadata

Just tell me which one you want.
