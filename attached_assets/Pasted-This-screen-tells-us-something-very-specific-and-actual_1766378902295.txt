This screen tells us something very specific and actually rules out a native crash.

Key observation
	•	Expo Go works
	•	TestFlight does NOT crash
	•	No crash logs in App Store Connect
	•	You see “Something went wrong” with a Try Again button

👉 This is NOT a TestFlight crash.
👉 This is your app’s error boundary or fallback UI being triggered in production.

In other words: JavaScript runtime error during app startup, not a native iOS crash.

That is why:
	•	TestFlight shows no crash logs
	•	Xcode shows nothing
	•	The app stays open but shows this screen

What This Screen Almost Always Means in Expo Apps

In production builds (TestFlight), these differ from Expo Go:
	1.	process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_* values
	2.	API base URLs
	3.	Permissions handling
	4.	Dynamic imports
	5.	Optional native modules
	6.	RevenueCat / Stripe / analytics init
	7.	fetch calls to localhost or http

Your error boundary is catching an unhandled JS exception on launch.

Step-by-Step: How to Find the Exact Cause

STEP 1: Identify where this screen comes from (critical)

Search your codebase for any of these:

Something went wrong
Try Again
ErrorBoundary
Fallback

Common places:
	•	ErrorBoundary.tsx
	•	App.tsx
	•	Root navigator wrapper

You likely have something like:

<ErrorBoundary fallback={<ErrorScreen />}>
  <App />
</ErrorBoundary>

This confirms it is your own error UI, not Apple.

⸻

STEP 2: Log the actual error (you are currently hiding it)

In your ErrorBoundary.tsx, you probably have something like:

componentDidCatch(error) {
  // maybe empty
}

Change it immediately to this:

componentDidCatch(error: Error, info: any) {
  console.log("ERROR BOUNDARY:", error);
  console.log("COMPONENT STACK:", info);
}

Then rebuild and upload a new TestFlight build.

Why this works:
	•	TestFlight captures console logs
	•	You will see the error in App Store Connect → TestFlight → Feedback → Logs

⸻

STEP 3: The 3 MOST COMMON causes (based on your history)

1️⃣ Missing environment variable (MOST LIKELY)
Expo Go loads .env dynamically.
Production builds bake values at build time.

Check for code like:

process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL
process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_RAPIDAPI_KEY
process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_KEY

If any are undefined, your app throws on startup.

✅ Fix:
	•	Ensure they are defined in:
	•	app.config.ts OR
	•	app.json under extra OR
	•	EAS secrets (if using EAS)

Temporary test:

console.log("API URL:", process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL);

If undefined → that’s the bug.

⸻

2️⃣ API calls to localhost or HTTP
Expo Go allows:

http://localhost:5000

TestFlight does NOT.

If your app does:

fetch("http://localhost:5000/api/...")

It will silently fail and throw.

✅ Fix:
	•	Use a real HTTPS backend URL
	•	Or conditional logic:

const API_URL = __DEV__
  ? "http://localhost:5000"
  : "https://your-api.com";


⸻

3️⃣ RevenueCat / native SDK initialisation
Very common pattern:

Purchases.configure({ apiKey });

If apiKey is undefined → JS throws → error boundary triggers.

Expo Go sometimes masks this.

✅ Fix:

if (apiKey) {
  Purchases.configure({ apiKey });
}


⸻

STEP 4: Quick Isolation Test (VERY IMPORTANT)

Temporarily comment out everything except navigation in App.tsx.

Example:

export default function App() {
  return <Text>App Loaded</Text>;
}

If this works in TestFlight:
	•	You have confirmed a startup dependency failure

Then re-enable:
	1.	Theme provider
	2.	Query client
	3.	Auth
	4.	RevenueCat
	5.	API calls

One at a time.
The moment it breaks, you’ve found the cause.

⸻

Why Expo Go Works but TestFlight Doesn’t (Summary)

Expo Go	TestFlight
Dynamic env vars	Build-time only
Localhost allowed	❌
Dev permissions	❌
Debug polyfills	❌
Error overlay	❌

Your app is depending on dev-only behaviour.

⸻

What To Do Right Now (No Guessing)

Please do one of the following and report back:
	1.	Paste your ErrorBoundary.tsx
	2.	Paste your App.tsx
	3.	Tell me:
	•	How you define API URLs
	•	How you define env vars
	•	Whether RevenueCat or similar runs on app load

I will pinpoint the exact line causing this and tell you exactly what to change.

You are very close. This is a classic Expo → TestFlight transition issue, not a major failure.
