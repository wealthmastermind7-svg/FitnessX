To make a fitness app genuinely *outstanding*, the “wow” feature must do **something users cannot easily replace with YouTube, Apple Fitness+, or a generic AI coach**. The strongest apps today win by collapsing *thinking, planning, and motivation* into a single moment.

Below are **high-impact wow features**, ordered by *defensibility and user stickiness*.
