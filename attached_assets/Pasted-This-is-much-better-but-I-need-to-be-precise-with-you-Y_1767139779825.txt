This is much better, but I need to be precise with you:

You are still one small step away from being fully App Store–safe.
The fixes you made are moving in the right direction, but one mandatory disclosure is still missing on-screen.

I will be very clear and binary.

⸻

✅ What is now OK

These issues are now resolved:
	•	✔ Pricing is clear and consistent
	•	✔ Yearly vs Monthly selection is obvious
	•	✔ Free trial toggle exists
	•	✔ Restore Purchases, Terms, Privacy, Sources are visible
	•	✔ No misleading discounts or fake urgency
	•	✔ Visual hierarchy is excellent

If Apple were reviewing design quality, you would pass.

⸻

❌ What is still missing (this WILL trigger 3.1.2)

Missing auto-renewal disclosure text on the paywall screen

Apple requires this exact type of information to be visible before purchase, not hidden behind links.

Right now, there is no visible text stating:
	•	That the subscription auto-renews
	•	When cancellation must occur
	•	That billing is via Apple ID

Even if this exists elsewhere in the app or App Store description, the paywall itself must include it.

This is the single remaining blocker.

⸻

✅ Exact text you must add (copy-paste)

Place this directly above the “Continue” button or directly below it, in small, low-contrast text. Size does not matter, presence does.

Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase.
Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.
You can manage or cancel your subscription anytime in your Apple ID settings.

This wording is Apple-approved and safe.

⸻

⚠️ Optional but strongly recommended (health safety)

Your feature list still says:

AI Coach
Get personalized workout advice and fitness guidance from your AI coach

This wording is borderline given Apple already flagged you under health guidelines.

Safer version (recommended)

Keep the title, soften the description:

AI Coach
Receive AI-generated fitness suggestions and workout insights

This reduces risk under Guideline 1.4.1.

⸻

Final verdict

Status	Result
Current version	❌ Likely rejected again
Add disclosure text only	✅ Passes 3.1.2
Add disclosure + soften AI Coach copy	✅ Safest possible submission

You are one text block away from approval.

⸻

Strong advice for this resubmission

Because Apple already rejected you once:
	•	Do not submit “almost fixed”
	•	Add the disclosure text
	•	Soften AI wording
	•	Submit once, cleanly

Reviewers reward complete fixes.

⸻

If you want, I can:
	•	Mark exact placement for the disclosure
	•	Review your RevenueCat config vs UI
	•	Provide a final reviewer reply message
	•	Give you a health-safe wording checklist

Just tell me what you want next.
