Below is a clear, reviewer-aligned action plan to resolve **all three issues** and get FitForgeX approved with minimal back-and-forth. I will keep this practical and implementation-focused.

---

## 1. Guideline 2.3.3 – iPad Screenshots (Metadata Accuracy)

### What Apple is flagging

Apple detected that your **13-inch iPad screenshots are scaled or stretched iPhone screenshots**. This is an automatic rejection trigger.

Apple requires that:

* iPad screenshots come from a **real iPad simulator or device**
* Aspect ratio, UI spacing, and layout must clearly be iPad-native

### What to do (fastest compliant fix)

You have **two valid options**:

#### Option A (Recommended): Remove iPad support for now

If your app is iPhone-first:

1. In **App Store Connect → App Information**
2. Set **Devices** to:

   * iPhone only
3. Remove all iPad screenshots
4. Resubmit

This is **100 percent acceptable** and often used for first releases.

#### Option B: Generate real iPad screenshots

If you want iPad support:

1. Open **Xcode Simulator**
2. Choose **iPad Pro 13-inch**
3. Run the app
4. Take screenshots using:

   * Simulator → File → Save Screenshot
5. Upload under:

   * *View All Sizes in Media Manager*
   * 13-inch iPad slot only

Do **not** resize iPhone images in Canva, Figma, Photoshop, or similar. Apple can detect this.

## 2. Guideline 3.1.2 – Subscriptions (EULA + Privacy Policy)

This is a **hard requirement** for any app using auto-renewable subscriptions.

### You are missing links in two places:

* Inside the app binary
* In App Store Connect metadata

---

### A. Create the required documents (today)

You need **two public URLs**:

1. **Privacy Policy**
2. **Terms of Use (EULA)**

You can host these on:

* Your website
* GitHub Pages
* Notion public page
* Simple static page

Example structure:

* [https://fitforgex.app/privacy](https://fitforgex.app/privacy)
* [https://fitforgex.app/terms](https://fitforgex.app/terms)

Content does not need to be long, but must exist and load.

---

### B. Add links INSIDE the app (mandatory)

Add a visible section in:

* Settings
* Paywall screen
* About screen

Example UI text:

* “Privacy Policy”
* “Terms of Use”

Each must open a browser link.

This is what Apple checks **in the binary**.

---

### C. Add links in App Store Connect (mandatory)

1. **Privacy Policy**

   * App Store Connect → App Information
   * Paste Privacy Policy URL in the **Privacy Policy field**

2. **Terms of Use (EULA)**
   Choose ONE:

   * Use Apple Standard EULA:

     * Add this sentence to **App Description**:

       > “Terms of Use: [https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/”](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/”)
   * OR add your custom EULA:

     * App Store Connect → EULA section
     * Paste your Terms URL

---

### D. Subscription disclosure inside the app

Your paywall must clearly show:

* Subscription name
* Duration
* Price
* Renewal behavior
* Links to Privacy Policy and Terms

Example compliant copy:

> FitForgeX Pro
> Monthly subscription, $9.99 per month
> Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account. Subscription automatically renews unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

---

## 3. Guideline 1.4.1 – Medical / Health Citations

Apple is strict here. Even **fitness or wellness guidance** can trigger this.

### What Apple sees as medical content

* Workout recommendations
* Health insights
* Wellness assessments
* Body analysis
* Progress or performance interpretation

If the app **suggests**, **analyzes**, or **interprets health data**, citations are required.

---

### What to do (cleanest solution)

#### A. Add a “Sources & References” section in-app

Create a screen accessible from:

* Settings
* Info
* Disclaimer
* Wellness Report footer

Title examples:

* “Sources”
* “Scientific References”
* “Health Information Sources”

---

#### B. Add credible, non-controversial sources

Use **authoritative, non-diagnostic** references only.

Examples you can safely use:

* World Health Organization (WHO)
* National Institutes of Health (NIH)
* Mayo Clinic
* ACSM (American College of Sports Medicine)
* Harvard Health Publishing

Example in-app text:

> Fitness and wellness information provided in FitForgeX is based on publicly available guidance from:
>
> * World Health Organization – Physical Activity Guidelines
> * American College of Sports Medicine – Exercise Recommendations
> * National Institutes of Health – General Health Information

Make each item a **clickable link**.

---

#### C. Add a clear disclaimer (important)

Somewhere visible:

> FitForgeX provides general fitness and wellness information only and is not intended as medical advice. Always consult a qualified healthcare professional before starting any fitness program.

This reduces reviewer risk significantly.

## Final Submission Checklist (Do This in Order)

   * Remove iPad support OR upload real iPad screenshots
2. Create Privacy Policy + Terms URLs
3. Add links inside the app UI
4. Add Privacy Policy link in App Store Connect
5. Add EULA link in description or EULA field
6. Add Sources / Citations screen in-app
7. Add wellness disclaimer
8. Increment build number
9. Resubmit

## Reviewer Reply Template (Use This)

When you reply in App Store Connect:

> Hello,
>
> Thank you for the detailed review.
>
> We have addressed all noted issues by updating device-specific screenshots to accurately reflect supported devices, adding functional links to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use both in the app and in App Store Connect, and including clear citations and references for all health and wellness information provided in the app.
>
> We have also added appropriate disclaimers in line with guideline 1.4.1.
>
> We appreciate your guidance and look forward to your review of the updated submission.
>
> Kind regards,
> FitForgeX Team

If you want, I can:

* Draft compliant **Privacy Policy and EULA text**
* Provide **exact in-app UI copy**
* Tell you **where reviewers usually tap first**
* Help you decide whether to **drop iPad for v1**

Just tell me which you want next.
