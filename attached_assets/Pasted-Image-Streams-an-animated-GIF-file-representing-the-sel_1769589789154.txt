Response
200
The endpoint returns a streamed GIF image.
The response is not JSON.
The Content-Type header is always set to image/gif.
This endpoint is optimized for direct use in <img> tags or client-rendered previews.
📝 Notes
All images returned by this endpoint are in GIF format.
Subscription tier access:
BASIC → access to 180 resolution only
PRO → access to 180 and 360 resolutions
ULTRA and MEGA → access to all four resolutions: 180, 360, 720, and 1080
If a resolution higher than the user's tier is requested, the response defaults to the highest resolution allowed for their plan.
A 422 Unprocessable Entity error is returned if:
exerciseId is missing or invalid
resolution is missing or not one of the accepted values
A 500 Internal Server Error is returned if:
The image does not exist for the given parameters
There is a server-side issue retrieving the image
It is highly recommended to use this endpoint client-side by passing the rapidapi-key as a query parameter within an <img> tag or similar component to ensure smooth streaming and fast rendering.
